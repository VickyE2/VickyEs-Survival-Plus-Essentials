global-scale: 1
# Modifies the scale of all biome distribution, you can use this parameter
# to if you want just about every biome to be larger or smaller.
# By doubling the scale, you double the length & width of everything,
# e.g. if you have a biome that is 300 blocks wide with a scale of 1, and
# increase that scale to 2, that biome will generate 600 blocks wide.

continental-scale: 0.8

# Elevation

elevation-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of the elevation noise map. A larger scale results in larger distances

# Temperature

temperature-scale: 0.4
# Controls the scale of temperature zones. Most biomes are placed according to
# a temperature map so hot biomes can't generate next to cold biomes, as well as
# allowing for biomes of similar temperatures to generate together. Increasing this
# will increase the distance between temperature changes, which results in things like
# hot and cold biomes generating further apart - and vice versa when decreasing it.

# ---
# Caves
# ---

cave-biome-scale: 1
# Controls the scale of the placement of cave biomes, larger scale = bigger areas of

# Oceans

ocean-deep-threshold: -0.8
# Elevation at which deep oceans are placed. Higher number = larger area of deep ocean

# Controls in blocks how wide rivers can get.
# Default: 20

# Spot Biomes

# Spot biomes are special circular biomes scattered around the world.
