# VickyE's Survival Plus Essentials - Platform Antagnostic Verion

---
Uhhh so ig this is my document. I'll try documenting every thing (only in VSPE module) that this project offers...

## [VSPEPlatformPlugin.java](VSPE/src/main/java/org/vicky/vspe/platform/VSPEPlatformPlugin.java):
> This is the platform antagnostic interface the other platforms should implement on ther main class to allow the other classes in this project to access utilities and other data variables.
> <br> It is worth it to note that the #isNative() just specifies if the platform its being used on allows for custom item registering.
